Description: This package is the user interface to the wqbench R package and 
  allows users to easily access standardized ecotoxicology data for thousands of 
  chemicals. Either a SSD or deterministic method is used to determine the 
  critical toxicity value and assessment factors to compute the aquatic life 
  water quality benchmark for a compound.
