Description: This package is the user interface to the wqbench R package
    and allows users to easily access standardized ecotoxicology data for
    thousands of chemicals. Either a SSD or deterministic method is used
    to determine the critical toxicity value and assessment factors to
    compute the aquatic life water quality benchmark for a compound.
